# StudentManagment

this branch adds an Instructor model and updates the Course model to have an Instructor attribute, also edits the DBContext to have a Dbset for Instructor and creates a relation between the Instructors DbSet and Course DbSet.
the Course attribute Instructor is nullable to start that can be changed when all Courses have an instructor.
