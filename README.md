# StudentManagment

this branch updates the student model to have a date of birth, I made it nullable to start to ensure that you can still access older data, you will be able to make it not nullable when all students have a birthday added, you could also have added a default date to fill out the column in the database, but that is a bad idea in my opinion since it could have a big impact on existing data
